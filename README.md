This repo is to build [CoralProject Talk](https://github.com/coralproject/talk).
The official CoarlProejct Talk repository itself is released by Apache 2.0 license.

This repo is mainly for (cross) building ARMv8 container **for my own use**.
Please use the official binary/container from Coral Project.

Idea is from StackOverflow:

The part for using cosign inside the GitHub actions is referenced from [Kyverno](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno)
